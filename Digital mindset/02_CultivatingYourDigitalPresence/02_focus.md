# Focus on the Right Data

## Illustration: Atmospheric Research Lab

- Digital collaboration tools expose vast amount of information
- Not all visible data is important or useful
- Social content can lead to focus on the wrong data

## Example: IT Technicians

- Reorganization brings together IT technicians
- Seniority initially used as proxy for expertise
- Digital collaboration tool implemented
- Jill, the most junior technician, is the most knowledgeable
- Coworkers turn to Jill with questions
- Peggy, the most senior technician, quits
- Coworkers value Jill's technical details over Peggy's input
- Peggy had cultural and political knowledge
- Evaluations from scientists plummet after Peggy's departure
- IT manager hires Peggy back and encourages diversifying knowledge sharing

## Importance of Visibility

- Most visible information and knowledge perceived as most important
- Contributions and strengths must show up in posts or messages
- Organization benefits from recorded information
- Establishing a digital presence requires intentional communication

# Remain "In Mind" When "Out of Sight"

## Challenges of Remote Work

- Face-to-face interaction benefits lost in remote work
- Nonverbal communication and spontaneous interaction diminished
- Shared experiences and physical presence contribute to bonding

## Developing a Digital Mindset

- Recognize the mutual knowledge problem in remote teams
- Teams can become out of sync without physical presence
- Managers must actively maintain presence in remote teams
- Define presence as being noticeable and salient to others
- Managing presence and building social lubrication
