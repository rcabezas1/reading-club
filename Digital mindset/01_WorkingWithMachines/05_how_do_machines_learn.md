# How Do Machines Learn?

## Understanding AI and Machine Learning

- AI is based on machine learning techniques
- Machine learning algorithms derive predictions from data using statistics
- Computers learn from examples and generalize from data

## Learning the Difference Between Cats and Dogs

- Label pictures as "cat" or "dog"
- Feed labeled pictures to the algorithm
- Machine reads patterns of pixels in labeled pictures
- Patterns are stored as examples of the labels (cat or dog)
- Computer needs many pictures to identify patterns and improve accuracy
- Ability to adapt and learn is considered intelligence

## Evolution of Machine Learning

- Mathematics has been around for a long time
- Vast amounts of data and high computing power make math useful in the real world

## Classic Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning

- Classic machine learning relies on predefined features
- Deep learning discovers features on its own using neural networks
- Artificial neurons arranged in layers enable deep learning
- Deep learning requires a large number of parameters and data

## Deep Learning in Facial Recognition

- Deep learning examines data to discover relevant features
- Improves accuracy without explicitly defining features
- Computer vision is the application of deep learning to images

## Machine Learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- NLP is to spoken text what computer vision is to images
- NLP follows a script to classify language into categories
- Phrases are labeled, cleaned, lemmatized, stemmed, and vectorized
- Machine learning algorithms identify patterns and correlations in text

## Machine Learning in Yelp's Image Classification

- Yelp uses machine learning to label and categorize images
- Labels are attached based on user comments
- Neural networks are trained to do computer vision
- Machine learning accelerates the image labeling process

## Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning

- Supervised learning involves training an algorithm with labeled data
- Unsupervised learning allows the algorithm to classify data on its own
- Reinforcement learning involves constant correction and feedback

## Advancements in AI and Clinical Applications

- AI is applied to clinical problems for improved diagnostics
- AI algorithms analyze medical images and detect abnormalities
- AI can identify cancers and reduce overlooked cases
- Adjustments in medical practice and workflows are needed

## More Data and Processing Power

- AI's power increases with more available data and processing power
- Digital transactions and sensor deployment contribute to data growth
- Future progress depends on data, computing power, and advanced algorithms
- Quantum computing is being developed to power AI systems

## Get to Know Your Technology Stack

- AI systems are built on a complex and interdependent technology stack
- Technology stack is the hardware and software systems needed to develop and run an application
- Consists of front-end and back-end systems linked together by middleware
- Understanding the technology stack helps in assessing the impact of changes

## Treat AI Like a Machine, Even If It Seems to Act Like a Human

- Advances in AI enable more natural-feeling and human-like interactions
- Conversational user interfaces (UI) allow people to interact with digital tools through writing or talking
- Examples of conversational UIs include virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant
- Treating AI as a machine and providing explicit instructions leads to better results
- Mistaking computers for humans can lead to unmet expectations and frustration

## Build Trust to Team with Machines: Human-Agent Teaming

- Technologies are becoming like team members that can interact, suggest, and act on decisions
- Trusting machine team members is crucial for successful human-agent teaming
- Machine learning allows computers to adjust their behavior based on data
- Developing a digital mindset involves trusting the capabilities of AI machines
- Examples of AI machines achieving better results than humans in specific tasks
