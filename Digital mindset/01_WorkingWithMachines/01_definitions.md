# Definitions

Before we get too far, we should set out some definitions. Terms like digital mindset can be interpreted in many ways. These are our working definitions for this book.

- **Digital:** The interaction between data and technology.
- **Data:** Any information that can be used for reference, analysis, or computation.
- **Technology:** The creation, capture, transformation, transmission, or storage of data.
- **Mindset:** The set of approaches used to make sense out of the world.
- **Digital Mindset:** The set of approaches used to make sense of, and make use of, data and technology. It enables people and organizations to see new possibilities and chart a path for the future.

## Digital Forces Reshaping How We Live and Work

Big data, algorithms, AI, robotic teammates, internal social media, blockchain, experimentation, statistics, security, and rapid change are some of the major digital forces that are reshaping how we live and work. These forces disrupt how we interact with colleagues and create new demands to restructure organizations to become more competitive.

## Redefining Key Processes

Developing a digital mindset means redefining fundamental approaches to three key processes:

1. Collaboration
2. Computation
3. Change

## Building Skills and Developing a New Mindset

Developing a new mindset involves not just building skills but also changing behavior and seeing the world in a new way. In this book, a framework is provided to outline the skills required to develop approaches to collaboration, computation, and change. The focus is on what you need to be digitally proficient, with the understanding that you only need about 30 percent fluency in a handful of technical topics to develop your digital mindset (the 30 percent rule).

## The 30 Percent Rule

- **Explanation:** The 30 percent rule is analogous to learning a foreign language, where achieving 30 percent proficiency is sufficient for effective communication.
- **Applying to Digital Mindset:** Mastering coding or becoming a data scientist is not necessary, but understanding key concepts and techniques is crucial.
- **Skills Overview:** The book specifies categories of skills needed for collaboration, computation, and change.
- **Thinking Differently:** Achieving 30 percent competence creates a foundation for thinking digitally and exploring new possibilities.
- **Insights and Learning:** The book provides new insights and connections to job, organizational strategy, and digital aspects.
- **Goal:** Attaining 30 percent proficiency in each area to develop a digital mindset.
- **Key Insights:** Distilled, synthesized, and curated key insights across digital domains.
